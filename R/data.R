#'@description Example of the results achieved by "EvaluatePanel" function
#'@format A list of 3 vectors: i) a list nameed afmatrix containing 42 data.frames, each of which exhibiting the allele frequecies of alleles on a locus with the row names being the corresponding names of such alleles; ii) a data.fram with 1 row and 42 columns containing the frequencies of rare alleles on the 42 loci; and iii) a data.frame named indicators with 42 columns and 12 rows containing the main effeciency indicators of the 42 loci.
